\opening{Dear Editors,}

I am pleased to submit the manuscript entitled \textbf{``Logging, Versioning, and Provenance in Generative AI Studies: A Protocol for Auditability and Scientific Reproducibility''} for consideration for publication in the \textit{Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research}.

This work addresses a timely and critical challenge in AI research: the reproducibility of studies that rely on large language model outputs. While the AI reproducibility crisis has been widely documented, existing experiment-tracking tools were not designed for the specific challenges of generative text outputs. Our paper makes three contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{A lightweight protocol} introducing novel documentation artifacts---Prompt Cards and Run Cards---built on the W3C PROV data model for machine-readable provenance graphs.

    \item \textbf{An empirical evaluation} through 330 controlled experiments with LLaMA~3 8B (local) and GPT-4 (API), revealing a striking reproducibility gap between local and API-based inference. Notably, GPT-4 achieves only 20\% exact match rate for summarization under nominally deterministic settings---a finding that is invisible without systematic logging.

    \item \textbf{A reference implementation} in Python with all experimental data publicly available for independent verification.
\end{enumerate}

We believe this work is well suited for JAIR for several reasons: (a) it addresses a foundational methodological issue affecting all AI research that uses generative models; (b) it provides rigorous empirical evidence rather than purely conceptual arguments; (c) the protocol and tools are immediately practical for the AI research community; and (d) the paper's scope---spanning reproducibility, provenance, and empirical methodology---aligns with JAIR's broad interest in AI foundations.

The protocol adds negligible overhead (0.69\% of inference time, 4.17~KB per run) while providing complete audit trails, tamper detection via cryptographic hashing, and interoperable provenance graphs. We hope these tools will contribute to raising the bar for reproducibility in generative AI research.

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by any other journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to JAIR.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
