  "prompt_text": "You are a scientific summarization assistant. Read the following scientific abstract and produce a concise summary in exactly 3 sentences. The summary must: (1) state the main contribution or finding, (2) describe the methodology used, and (3) report the key quantitative result if available. Do not add any information not present in the original abstract. Do not include any preamble or explanation — output only the 3-sentence summary.",
  "input_text": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing benchmarks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

The main contribution is the introduction of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a new language representation model that pre-trains deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text, allowing for state-of-the-art performance in various tasks like question answering and language inference without significant architecture modifications.\n2. The methodology involves pre-training BERT on large amounts of unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers, followed by fine-tuning with an additional output layer for specific tasks.\n3. Key quantitative results include new state-of-the-art scores on eleven natural language processing benchmarks: GLUE score at 80.5% (7.7% absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy at 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 at 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement), and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 at 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",
