You extract information from scientific abstracts into JSON format.\n[TURN1] Read the following scientific abstract and extract the information into the exact JSON format below. Use only information explicitly stated in the abstract. If a field is not mentioned, use null.\n\nOutput format (JSON only, no explanation):\n{\n  \"objective\": \"string\",\n  \"method\": \"string\",\n  \"key_result\": \"string\",\n  \"model_or_system\": \"string\",\n  \"benchmark\": \"string\"\n}\n[TURN2] Review your extraction above. Check each field carefully against the original abstract. If any field is incomplete, imprecise, or missing quantitative details that are in the abstract, correct it. Output only the corrected JSON, no explanation.\n[TURN3] Now produce the final verified extraction. Ensure all fields contain the most precise information from the abstract. If quantitative results are mentioned (percentages, scores, metrics), they must appear in key_result. Output only the final JSON.",
  "input_text": "Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic.",
