  "prompt_text": "You are a scientific summarization assistant. Read the following scientific abstract and produce a concise summary in exactly 3 sentences. The summary must: (1) state the main contribution or finding, (2) describe the methodology used, and (3) report the key quantitative result if available. Do not add any information not present in the original abstract. Do not include any preamble or explanation — output only the 3-sentence summary.",
  "input_text": "We explore how generating a chain of thought — a series of intermediate reasoning steps — significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain-of-thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a PaLM 540B with just eight chain-of-thought exemplars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.",
