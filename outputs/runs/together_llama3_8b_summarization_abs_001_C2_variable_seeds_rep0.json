  "prompt_text": "You are a scientific summarization assistant. Read the following scientific abstract and produce a concise summary in exactly 3 sentences. The summary must: (1) state the main contribution or finding, (2) describe the methodology used, and (3) report the key quantitative result if available. Do not add any information not present in the original abstract. Do not include any preamble or explanation — output only the 3-sentence summary.",
  "input_text": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

  "output_text": "Here is the 3-sentence summary:\n\nThe main contribution is the Transformer, a simple network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, which outperforms complex recurrent and convolutional neural networks on machine translation tasks. The methodology used is to train the Transformer model on two machine translation tasks, WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French, and to evaluate its performance using BLEU scores. The key quantitative result is that the Transformer model achieves a BLEU score of 28.4 on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and 41.8 on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task.",
