  "input_text": "Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. We also explore the limits of transfer learning by scaling up models and data as much as computationally feasible. Our largest model, which we refer to as T5, achieves state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks while being flexible enough to be cast into any text-based task. To promote reproducibility and enable direct comparison of the many approaches we cover, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.",
