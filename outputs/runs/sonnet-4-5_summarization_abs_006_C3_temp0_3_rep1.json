  "prompt_text": "You are a scientific summarization assistant. Read the following scientific abstract and produce a concise summary in exactly 3 sentences. The summary must: (1) state the main contribution or finding, (2) describe the methodology used, and (3) report the key quantitative result if available. Do not add any information not present in the original abstract. Do not include any preamble or explanation — output only the 3-sentence summary.",
  "input_text": "We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.",

  "output_text": "This paper introduces Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a framework where a generative model G and discriminative model D are trained simultaneously in an adversarial minimax game, with G learning to generate realistic samples while D learns to distinguish real from generated data. The authors prove that for arbitrary functions, a unique solution exists where G recovers the true data distribution and D outputs 1/2 everywhere, and implement both models as multilayer perceptrons trained via backpropagation without requiring Markov chains or approximate inference. Experiments provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrating the framework's potential for generating samples.",
