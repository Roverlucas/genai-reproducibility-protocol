  "prompt_text": "You are a scientific summarization assistant. Read the following scientific abstract and produce a concise summary in exactly 3 sentences. The summary must: (1) state the main contribution or finding, (2) describe the methodology used, and (3) report the key quantitative result if available. Do not add any information not present in the original abstract. Do not include any preamble or explanation — output only the 3-sentence summary.",
  "input_text": "How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.",

A stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm is introduced for efficient handling of continuous latent variables in large datasets with intractable posterior distributions, offering scalability and applicability even in intractable cases under mild differentiability conditions.\n2. The method involves reparameterizing the variational lower bound for optimization using standard stochastic gradient methods, and fitting an approximate inference model to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.\n3. Experimental results demonstrate theoretical advantages of the proposed approach. (Quantitative results are not explicitly provided in the abstract.)",
