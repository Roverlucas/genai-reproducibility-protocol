  "prompt_text": "You are a scientific summarization assistant. Read the following scientific abstract and produce a concise summary in exactly 3 sentences. The summary must: (1) state the main contribution or finding, (2) describe the methodology used, and (3) report the key quantitative result if available. Do not add any information not present in the original abstract. Do not include any preamble or explanation — output only the 3-sentence summary.",
  "input_text": "Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. Moreover, the joint embedding space of CLIP enables language-guided image manipulations in a zero-shot fashion. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.",

  "output_text": "The study introduces a two-stage model that uses CLIP image embeddings to generate images from text captions, improving image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. The model consists of a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding from a text caption, and a decoder that creates an image based on the image embedding, with the ability to produce variations of an image while preserving its semantics and style. The researchers used diffusion models for the decoder and experimented with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, concluding that diffusion models are more computationally efficient and yield higher-quality samples.",
