  "prompt_text": "You are a scientific summarization assistant. Read the following scientific abstract and produce a concise summary in exactly 3 sentences. The summary must: (1) state the main contribution or finding, (2) describe the methodology used, and (3) report the key quantitative result if available. Do not add any information not present in the original abstract. Do not include any preamble or explanation — output only the 3-sentence summary.",
  "input_text": "Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.",

  "output_text": "The main contribution is the introduction of long short-term memory (LSTM), a novel gradient-based method that addresses the vanishing gradient problem in recurrent networks by enabling learning over extended time intervals through constant error flow. LSTM employs special units with constant error carousels and multiplicative gate units that learn to open and close access to this flow, truncating gradients only where harmless, while remaining local in space and time with O(1) computational complexity per time step and weight. It bridges minimal time lags exceeding 1000 discrete-time steps and outperforms methods like real-time recurrent learning, backpropagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking on artificial long-time-lag tasks with local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy data.[1]",
